MEAlytics does not receive any other input about the amount of wells.</p>"},{"location":"supported_plates/#displaying-different-plate-types","title":"Displaying different plate types","text":""},{"location":"supported_plates/#displaying-wells","title":"Displaying wells","text":"<p>When given a certain amount of wells, MEAlytics will automatically calculate the optimal number of rows and columns for this well amount to display the different wells.
